                <div class="description">The screams. The three piece band. The hoodie on stage. His raspy voice. 
                    At 1:11, the music pauses, and the guy behind the camera just lets out a gutteral, slow "fuck".

                <div class="description">Fun, eccentric, and beautiful. 
                    A smiling but passive aggressive man from the building is interviewed while Bon Iver sets up. 
                    The man walks away, and they immediately start singing. Two women walk in. A dog walks in. 
                    Another woman opens the door, and it's as if she motions "forget it, I'll come back later". There's so much confusion, but Justin Vernon (middle) 
                    and Sean Carey (right) are full of conviction. I love Mike Noyce (left) who has a bit of reservation. 
                    His hands are in his pockets and he smiles shyly,
                    but he's there. He sings nonetheless.
